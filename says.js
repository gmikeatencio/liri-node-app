// 4. node liri.js do-what-it-says

// 		- Using the fs Node package, 
// 		- LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt 
// 		- and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

// 		- It should run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," 
//		- as follows the text in random.txt.
// 		- Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the 
//		- feature for other commands.
